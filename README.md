# AlgoLib
A Library of Algorithms!

This repo is for hacktoberfest! Just add an algorithm in whatever language you desire!

## Guidelines
- Please follow a camel case naming scheme (ex: BubbleSort.cpp)
- Code files should go into a directory with the same name as the language they were coded in (ex: Python/InsertionSort.py)

## Contributors
- StaneCobalt(https://github.com/StaneCobalt)

Other than that, just have fun! Happy Hacktober!
