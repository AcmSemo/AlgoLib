# AlgoLib
A Library of Algorithms!

This repo is for hacktoberfest! Just add an algorithm in whatever language you desire!

## What are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem. We always use algorithms in everyday life. Algorithms helps us to solve problems systematically and effectively without wasting time and resources. An example of an algorithm is "Make a tea algorithm".
Make a tea algorithm:
- Prepare the ingredients (teabag, sugar, water), a kettle, a stove, a cup, and a spoon
- Boil the water with kettle on the stove
- After the water is boiled, pour water into the cup
- Put a teabag in the cup and add some sugars
- Stir it with spoon
- Done

Computer algorithm is similar with common algorithm. The difference is computer algorithm built with computer language, not with human language. One division in computer algorithm that has been a long-time research is sort algorithm. Sort algorithm is one of the most important algorithm because computer nowadays always does sorting data. There are few sort algorithm: Bin, Merge, Bubble, Shell, and Quick.

## Guidelines
- Please follow a camel case naming scheme (ex: BubbleSort.cpp)
- Code files should go into a directory with the same name as the language they were coded in (ex: Python/InsertionSort.py)
- If somebody added an algorithm in a language you wanted to do, don't fret! Just add a number to the end of the filename and we'll add it on in! (ex: BubbleSort3.cpp)

Other than that, just have fun! Happy Hacktober!
