# AlgoLib
A Library of Algorithms!

This repo is for hacktoberfest! Just add an algorithm in whatever language you desire!

## Guidelines
- Please follow a camel case naming scheme (ex: BubbleSort.cpp)
- Code files should go into a directory with the same name as the language they were coded in (ex: Python/InsertionSort.py)
- If somebody added an algorithm in a language you wanted to do, don't fret! Just add a number to the end of the filename and we'll add it on in! (ex: BubbleSort3.cpp)

Other than that, just have fun! Happy Hacktober!
