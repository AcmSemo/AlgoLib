A Library of Algorithms!

This repo is for hacktoberfest! Just add an algorithm in whatever language you desire!

## Guidelines
- Please follow a camel case naming scheme (ex: BubbleSort.cpp)
- Code files should go into a directory with the same name as the language they were coded in (ex: Python/InsertionSort.py)
